# Day 6 - Explore SharePoint Online as a Microsoft 365 Enterprise Administrator

## Introduction

So I figured SharePoint was the easiest App to start with. 



## Cloud Documentation

Interestingly enough, what makes this the "easiest App to start with" is the fact that I'm most comfortable with it.  As I was going through the MS Learn course, there wasn't anything actually new for me to learn.  Obviously that doesn't mean I know everything.  Not by a long shot.  However, I do know more about SharePoint than any of the other apps.  Therefore, I'm going to call today a wash and start on tomorrow early.
