# Day 2 - Licensing & Azure AD Admin Roles

## Introduction




## Cloud Research


The trial and error here was mostly having to try about a dozen times to get the trial setup.  In the end, I had to start over with a new tenant. 


### Step 1 — Setup a Trial Microsoft 365 E3 License for ClandaTechnology.com Tenant

Normally, this would be a very simple process, however, there seems to be something very janky going on with Microsoft allowing a previous trial tenant to setup a new trial.  Clearly, it doesn't work.  Therefore, I just created a new one.  Thankfully, I wasn't too far into the process of the old one. 

Created a One Month Trial of Microsoft 365 E3. 

### Step 2 - Setting me as Global Administrator and creating another user for a second administrator

Tony Stark is my first assistant and the other Global Administrator of Clanda Technology.  I think Steve Rogers will soon be hired as our Exchange Administrator.  I have several other administrator positions open and several excellent candidates in mind. 


## ☁️ Cloud Outcome

I now have 50 licenses to use for this lab and two administrators. 

## Next Steps

Not sure what I should do tomorrow.  Probably setup Exchange and Outlook.  Getting emails flowing is a useful feature to have.
