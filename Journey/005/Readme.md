# Day 5 - Miscellaneous Additional 365 Tenant Configurations

## Introduction

So I'm actually making pretty good progress in planning out various different lessons in the future.  However, I seem to be stuck on what I should go over and study right now.  Which helps me absolutely none at all!  So I figured I would go back through the Microsoft Learn lessons in their order and see if there was anything I either missed or wanted to emphasize.  

Additional Tenant Configurations seemed to be just fine and dandy for today's lesson.  

## Prerequisite

A presently functioning Microsoft 365 Tenant with a few missing configurations...




## Cloud Research

I'm pretty sure I did more research trying to figure out WHAT to study rather that HOW to do this part.  I'm just going through the Microsoft Learn lessons, step by step and making any changes, and documenting them if I do. 



### Part 1 — Summary 

- Organizational Profile:  While there are many different options and variations you can add to this, most of them would be easily configured if you already had company branding.  However, I don't have a company or branding since this is a lab.  Although, maybe one day in the future, Clanda Technology could be a real thing.  Who knows?   Fun fact:  If your company moves to a different country than where it was originally setup in MS 365, you have to create __an entirely new tenant from scratch!!__ 

It seems that was the only thing I hadn't configured in my tenant.  Oh well.

### Part 2 — Planning Ahead

While I have tons of ideas and cool plans of various lessons I could do for these 100 days, I have to remind myself that I am limited in time.  Both because I must pass MS-100 by the end of June, and because there are only 100 days in this challenge and only 130-ish days in total until my return.  Therefore, I must be more intelligent and efficient about the lessons I create and the topics in which I study.  

Looking at the weights of the sections in the MS-100 exam and how I scored on the first attempt, I feel my efforts will be much better spent working mostly on "Plan Microsoft Office 365 workloads and applications (25-30%)".  It goes along with the 80/20 rule I imagine.  Spend 20% of your time to get 80% of the results, or something to that effect.  The workloads and applications section was where I scored the lowest in the test and since it holds as much weight as the other highest section, it stands to reason that I need to focus most of my time on this while I have the time.  Once I am more confident in this section, I can review the others prior to the test.  After I pass the test, I will move forward in preparing and studying for the next one.

Therefore, (comma pause for effect!) I shall start off tomorrow bright eyed and bushy tailed. Metaphorically that is. I'm damned sure not going to be that way in real life. Ready to go, and starting on setting up, configuring, and deploying SharePoint Online services in Microsoft 365!

Semper Discens!
