# Day One! - Configuring the Tenant

## Introduction

Without an initial configuration and strong foundation of a tenant, any add-ons or follow on training within would not be of value.  I would be trying to fix problems that should never have existed.  

## Prerequisite

- How to create a new tenant in MS 365.  That's pretty much it.  While I'm starting from a pre-existing lab tenant, there isn't much configured so beyond the initial startup, I'm pretty much starting from scratch too.


## Try yourself

✍️ Add a mini tutorial to encourage the reader to get started learning something new about the cloud.

### Step 1 — Adding a Custom Domain

- Add a custom domain name to the tenant: In the Main Admin portal, select the Setup link on the left toolbar and one of the first options available should be to setup a custom domain name.  You can also use [this guide from Microsoft's Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/setup/add-domain?view=o365-worldwide) to help. 

### Step 2 — Reviewing the Licensing Structures and Selecting the Most Appropriate for your Lab / Tenant
