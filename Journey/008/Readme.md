# Day 8 - Elevate Privileges using Azure AD Priviledged Identity Management 

## Cloud Research

So to get started, here's the daily fact:  PIM is only available in EMS 365 E5 or Azure AD P2 Licensing Packages.  So yea.  You'll have to fork over some dough to get this gizmo.

Which also means I didn't get to play with it.  I just looked longingly at the menu and the interface from my console while the upgrade screen mocked me.  Oh well.  Maybe someday.

As for PIM, it is a newer feature that limits the amount of Administrative rights and roles that are handed out at any given time by enabling what's known as Just-in-Time access (JIT).  This JIT Access allows eligible users to request or be proactively granted roles and rights from other admins the permissions they need to carry out their own duties.  

However (comma pause for effect), what makes JIT different is that instead of said user keeping their roles until some uppity Security Inspector comes along and finds their excessive access, they are only granted the role for a liminted amount of time, at the end of which, the role is automatically removed, and they revert to being a regular user, or lower admin if the situation applies.
