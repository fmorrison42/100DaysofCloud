# Day 12 - Create reports and dashboards as a Microsoft 365 Enterprise Administrator with Power BI

## Introduction to Today's Project

Power BI is one of the Power Apps I know the least about.  If I'm going to pass the test, I need to learn more about it.  Today's the day.


## Research, Trials, & Outcomes

- Power BI is a collection of software services, apps and connectors that work together to turn unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights.  (That's the Microsoft sales pitch)  
What it means is that it can take all kinds of data from Excel spreadsheets to vast mountains of databases and collate them into useable, understandable tables and displays that provide insight into the inner workings of your company, or whatever it is you are tracking with this data. 

- 5 Basic Building Blocks of Power BI:  Datasets, Visualizations, Reports, Dashboards, Tiles

#### Power BI Components
- MS Windows Desktop application
- Online SaaS service
- Mobile Power BI apps 

Reports are created in Desktop then shared and distributed via the online service and consumed in service and apps.  Some tasks however can be done in both the Desktop and the Service. 

#### Power BI Administration

To administer Power BI, you have to be assigned one of the following roles: Global Admin (duh), Power BI admin, or Power Platform Admin. 

Power BI Admins have full control over org-wide Power BI settings and admin features, except for licensing.  They also do not have access to the Audit logs within Power BI.  

#### Data Sources & Connections

Standard Data Sources: 
- Microsoft Excel
- Salesforce
- Microsoft Dynamics
- Azure Blob Storage

Power BI Desktop supports 3 methods for connecting to data sources:
- Import, or a one time connection and download of the data into Power BI Desktop.
- Direct Query.  No data is imported or copied into PBI.  Instead, when the user creates a visualization, Power BI Desktop queries the underlying data source at the time of the visualization.  Therefore, the data being presented is always current.
- Live Connection.
