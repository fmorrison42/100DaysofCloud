# Day 7 - 365 Apps for Enterprise Overview


## Introduction

One of the subjects I scored poorly on was the planning and managed deployment of 365 Apps for Enterprise.  So here is the start of that series.  I will be doing several labs in my Tenant.  It will also expand into Endpoint & Configuration Manager. 



## Cloud Research

Most of the documentation and research I'm doing for today is from the Microsoft Learn course "Deploy Microsoft 365 Apps for Enterprise".



### Summary

There aren't any steps for today, it was mostly just reviewing the overview information and preparing for the labbing and active portions that are coming up. 



## Next Steps

Deploy Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise with Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager
