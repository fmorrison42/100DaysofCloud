# Day 11 - Create flows as a Microsoft 365 Enterprise Administrator with Power Automate

## Introduction

I've already created several basic flows in Power Automate for some simple shit and it's been useful but this lesson will incorporate it into being able to manage PA as an Enterprise Administrator.  It was also one of my weak spots on the test last time, so yea, I need to improve here. 


## Research

- Even though there are over 270 different connections available in PA, users still have to have permissions to each application to which they want to make connections or an automation.  The security behind PA is top notch. 

- PA flow development occurs in "Environments", such an apt name, but the good part is that there are distinct benefits to this: data locality (the data remains local to you and not spread across the world and risk it being compromised), data loss prevention (see previous benefit), isolation boundaries (see previous previous)...

- When a user adds another user or group as the owner of a flow, that flow becomes a TEAM FLOW. As such, it's only displayed under 'Team Flows'. 

## Procedure

It looks like there won't be much of a description or step by step of procedures today because the Power Automate lessons are mostly about the various features available for managing Power Automate as an Enterprise Administrator in MS 365.  

So therefore, I'm just putting my research notes for future reference and any Anki cards I think could be made and might be useful up here.
